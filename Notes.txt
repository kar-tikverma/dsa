4 components/pillars of OOPS:
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

In a class, if we don't initialize a varible of an object, then:
    If the variable is of 'int' type, its value will be set to 0 by default.
    If the variable is of 'char' type, its value will be set to '' (empty character) by default.
    If the variable is of 'float' or 'double' type, its value will be set to 0.0 by default.
    If the variable is of 'boolean' type, its value will be set to 'false' by default.
    If the variable is of 'Integer', 'Float', 'Double', 'Character', 'Boolean' type, its value
    will be set to 'null' by default.
